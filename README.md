---------------------- 
 
 
       Ppt2pdf.net is a useful tool that you can use it
       to convert ppts to pdfs at one time. 
 
 
       Ppt2pdf.net invokes some libraries from the .NET environment
       and it contains some components from the MS Office. So you can only 
       use it for non-profit purposes.
 

       Ppt2pdf.net is hosted at https://github.com/tevenfeng/ppt2pdf.net
